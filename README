jkdl-svg is a FOSS implementation of the "Depixelizing Pixel Art" algorithm from Johannes
Kopf & Dani Lischinski (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kopf/pixelart).

The primary goal is to provide a library and a stand-alone executable who takes an image
and outputs a vectorized version in SVG format. These SVG files can then be openened in 
a SVG editor (i.e. Inkscape) to make final adjustements.

The library is written with flexibility in mind, so that faster and maybe less optimized
results can be displayed in real-time for integration in various console emulators.
