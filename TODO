This file is not only a TODO list but also a brief description of the algorithm and the 
global progress of the implementation.

Vectorization global process:

1) Load raster image from file (loader.cxx)
[OK] Add PNG support for loading a network from raster data

2) Build the Visual Feature Network and remove connections
[  ] Connection removal on a color basis
[  ] Add "Island" score
[  ] Add "Curve" score
[  ] Add "Sparse" score
[  ] Removal on a score basis

3) Build the Voronoi diagram
[  ] Implementation of Voronoi partitionning algorithm
[  ] Simplification of the Voronoi partition

4) Resolve T-Junctions
[  ] Support for T-Junctions

5) Extract splines
[  ] Generate spline data

6) Optimize splines
[  ] Spline optimization

7) Resolve corner cases
[  ] Case detection module
[  ] Replacement of faulty zones
[  ] Improve edge-case heuristics

8) Render as SVG
[  ] Translate into a SVG-compatible model
[  ] Output SVG
